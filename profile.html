            <p >UX is not just about designing great experiences, it is about creating great experiences with services that help users solve their problems. Having a background in computer science helps me when trying to brainstorm innovative solutions. It provides me an understanding of the limitations and opportunities that available technologies offer. As a result, the products I design takes advantage technology in ways which aims to streamlines the user’s life.</p>
            <p>In addition, as a designer with a background in computer science, I am able to understand the needs and priorities of both the design team and the engineering team. Therefore, I can design services that does not sacrifice the user’s experience for technical implementation. In addition, these skills allow me to communicate efficiently with both designs and also software engineers.</p>

        <p class="subtitle" style="text-align: center;">My UX Background</p>
        <p class="ProfileContent" style="width: 90%; margin: auto;">I was introduced to the topic of “User Experience” when I attended a coding bootcamp during the Summer between my Sophomore and Junior year of college. I wasn’t able to do much regarding UX during my time there but it was definitely a field that I was very much interested in. I didn’t attend a design school, so when my Junior year started, I took it upon myself to learn about UX and create designs for any idea I had that could help users. While the designs I made during that time were not the greatest, it provided me the opportunity to be a UX Intern at a company called Mobile Heartbeat. My time at Mobile Heartbeat taught me a lot about common UX practices and the importance of having a design process. With the skills I learnt on my own and during my internship, I have designed services with the UX process from ideation to user testing.</p>
