        <!-- Body -->
        <div class="content">
        <p>Based on the results of the survey, I selected several participants to do in-depth interviews with. Interviewees supported the idea of transcribing lectures and allowing users to “highlight” the previously said sentences. A participant suggested allowing users to highlight several sentences at once. The app can provide users one button and based on the number of times pressed, the app will highlight the number of transcribed sentences accordingly.</p>
        <p>Respondents were concerned about the accuracy of transcribing different accents as many of their teachers are international. To make the notes as accurate as possible, one respondent proposed to allow the transcriptions to be editable. Alternatively, there could be a “share and compare” function; the app can automatically collect the lecture transcriptions from students who used the app during the class and compare the transcriptions to create a version with the most accurate data. Then, each student will receive the final version.</p>
        <p>For classes in which teachers don’t provide a pdf version of their powerpoints, participants have reported copying the entire powerpoints in their notes. In addition, respondents have said that professors often draw diagrams to supplement their lectures, however, when the student copies them down, the accuracy of the diagrams are often less than ideal. A possible feature to help this process is a camera tool that allows users to include the captured image in an appropriate place in the notes. The captured image can also be edited either by freehand drawing or by connecting dictated statements to specific locations on the image.</p>
        <p>Respondents reported preferring the traditional paper and pencil method for the ability to sketch free-handedly. The app can implement a feature which allows users to draw on their phone while transcribing and each stroke can be linked to a transcription. This can allow users to trace back to the audio and listen to the audio that was recorded when they were drawing.</p>
        <p>Many users were concerned about the format of the transcribed notes. Participants favored the organization of their notes when they type and write and wanted that feature to be included in the application. The application can include a feature to “indent”/ ”unindent”, therefore users can better structure their notes and mirror what they would have done otherwise when using paper/computer. All in all, users feel that this app should be very simple and require as little attention as possible.</p>
