            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>For my business course about consumer behavior, we were tasked to choose an existing company to understand the user’s behaviors of. Then, present several recommendations the company could implement based on the findings. Because my team chose Instagram, I was able to use this project as a chance to apply my extracurricular interests into my academics! The following is a condensed version of the presentation information but I have also included a link to view the entire slide deck.</p>

            <h1>Instagram Case Study</h1>
            <p>As a student, everywhere you go, there are always people using Instagram. Whether it is during lectures, while waiting for food,  or even when doing homework, there are students who check the app multiple times a day. So, if so many people use Instagram consistently, then why is it the case that there are those who use other social media apps but not Instagram? Our team went on to understand why people who frequently use the app use it. This way, we can present recommendations that can help accentuate values of Instagram that makes users become addicted to the application.</p>

                <center><img src="img/Instagram/TargetUserGroup.png"></center>
                <p>Millenials make up Instagram’s largest demographic. Any increase in their use of Instagram can greatly affect the performance of the company. Therefore,  this study is focused on Instagram’s users of the ages 18-29.</p>

                <div style="float: right; width: 60%; ">
                    <p>We begin our case study on Instagram by conducting a short questionnaire for the purpose of understanding what social media platforms participants use and also to do a background screening of them.</p>
                    <p>From the questionnaire, we were able to recruit participants who had Instagram accounts to participate in our focus group study.</p>

                <p>The focus group questions were structured in a way that eases the focus group participant into the topic of Instagram. The key questions are the main portion of which we can understand the user’s behavior. Each question in the diagram below has a short explanation for its purpose.</p>

                <p>After completing 3 focus groups, there were clear similarities that the participants showed and we concluded 3 motivations. However, we also understand that these motivations don’t apply to everyone.</p>

                            <p>“I feel that because Instagram was built as a mobile application, all the content can be absorbed really quickly as it is only an image with a caption. But for Facebook there are so many different types of content that it is more challenging to go through your feed quickly on a mobile device.”</p>

                <p>The laddering interviews were semi-structured. In order to allow the conversation to flow naturally, there was no order to the questions. And we asked them as we saw fit.

The discussion to these helped us understand which needs of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs does Instagram satisfy.</p>

                    <div style="float: right;width: 60%; height:100%; vertical-align: middle;">
                        <p style="vertical-align: middle;">Several laddering interviewees noted that they mainly follow travel and food Instagrams accounts as they use the app as a way to get inspiration for places to visit. Users can use the existing bookmarking function and save posts into specific collections. This suggestion gives the user a map view pinning the locations of the posts in the collection. The map function allows users to more efficiently plan for trips which further satisfies the user's’ accomplishment need.</p>

                        <p>Participants have noted that they valued the various privacy options which Facebook and Wechat offers. Users noted that for different groups of people, they present a different image. This recommendation allows users to block spcific users/groups from viewing a single post. Users can now maintain a consistent image that they have created for the different groups, which adds to the belonging and self-esteem need.</p>

                    <div style="float: right;width: 60%; height:100%; vertical-align: middle;">
                        <p style="vertical-align: middle;">User’s have noted that they value the recommendations of their friend’s more than the recommendations of strangers (even over specialized accounts). This recommendation further satisfies the accomplishment need as users can more easily get reliable recommnedations for places to visit. Also, for many users, Instagram is a way to stalk their friends. So this recomendation can also help people accomplish that activity.</p>

                    <div style="float: left;width: 60%; height:100%; vertical-align: middle;">
                        <p style="vertical-align: middle;">Similar to the “Explore” tab, this recommendation suggests posts to users according to their interests. However in this case, the posts are suggested based on the collection. This recommendation helps satisfy the accomplishment need as users can find posts that are not just similar to their interests but also similar to the collection.</p>

                    </center>
                </div>

                <p style=" text-align: center;">By implementing these recommendations, Instagram can enhance its areas in which it stands out and differentiates itself from the other social media applications in. As it better satisfies the belonging, self-esteeme, and accomplishment needs, more users will find more value in the app convert to daily users.</p>

            <p>The main purpose of the case study was to implement specific interviewing techniques such as questionnaires, focus groups, and laddering interviews. My current UX process is all the same except that I use regular in-depth interviews instead of laddering interviews. So using the new method allowed me to take away very useful but also different information as I would have gotten from regular interviews. I find that this technique is very useful when the application exists and you want to implement new functionalities or take away pointless ones. In the future, I plan on integrating this method for projects which revolves around existing applications.</p>
